Main Flow Diagram for Q-Learning:
Environment → Preprocessing → Train-Test Split → Train Base Model (Q-Learning) → Evaluate → Deploy Policy.

Detailed Workflow Diagram for Q-Learning:
Raw Data  
│  
├── Environment Setup → Define the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)  
│ ├── Identify States (S) → Possible situations the agent can be in  
│ ├── Define Actions (A) → Possible moves the agent can make  
│ ├── Specify Rewards (R) → Positive/negative feedback for actions  
│ ├── Define Transition Function (P) → Probability of moving from one state to another  
│ └── Set Terminal Conditions → Define when an episode ends  
│  
├── Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
│ ├── Visualize the Environment (Grid representation, state transitions)  
│ ├── Analyze Initial State Distribution (Starting positions, randomness)  
│ ├── Assess Reward Distribution (Check for high/low reward imbalance)  
│ ├── Identify Potential State Loops (Detect infinite loops in state transitions)  
│ ├── Evaluate Action Effectiveness (Analyze impact of actions in various states)  
│ ├── Detect Reward Clipping Needs (Normalize rewards if necessary)  
│ └── Analyze Convergence Requirements (Determine number of episodes needed)  
│  
├── Preprocessing  
│ ├── Encode State Representations (Convert state observations into numeric form)  
│ ├── Initialize Q-Table (Set Q-values to zeros or small random values)  
│ ├── Define Hyperparameters (Learning rate α, discount factor γ, exploration rate ε)  
│ ├── Implement ε-Greedy Strategy (Balance exploration vs. exploitation)  
│ ├── Normalize Rewards (Scale rewards for better learning stability)  
│ ├── Set Episode Length Constraints (Limit steps per episode)  
│ └── Configure Logging for Debugging (Track reward trends over time)  
│  
├── Train-Test Split  
│ ├── Train (80%) → Use majority of episodes for training the Q-table  
│ ├── Validation (10%) → Tune exploration rate, learning rate, and discount factor  
│ └── Test (10%) → Evaluate final policy performance  
│  
├── Base Model Training (Q-Learning Algorithm)  
│ ├── Initialize Q-table with all zeros  
│ ├── Loop through Episodes (Repeat learning process multiple times)  
│ ├── Select Action Using ε-Greedy Strategy  
│ ├── Observe Next State and Reward  
│ ├── Update Q-value Using Bellman Equation:  
│ │   **Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α [ R + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) ]**  
│ ├── Adjust Exploration Rate Over Time (Decrease ε gradually)  
│ ├── Track Episode Rewards (Sum rewards per episode)  
│ ├── Save Best Policy When Converged  
│ └── Store Final Q-Table for Deployment  
│  
├── Evaluation  
│ ├── Compute Average Reward per Episode (Measure policy improvement)  
│ ├── Visualize Q-Table Convergence (Check if values stabilize over time)  
│ ├── Assess Policy Stability (Ensure optimal actions are consistently chosen)  
│ ├── Compare Performance With Random Policy (Baseline comparison)  
│ ├── Validate Generalization (Test policy in unseen environments)  
│ ├── Track Success Rate (Percentage of optimal episodes)  
│ ├── Identify Failure Cases (Analyze why episodes fail)  
│ └── Tune Hyperparameters if Necessary  
│  
├── Deploy Policy  
│ ├── Use Final Q-Table for Action Selection (Pick highest Q-value action)  
│ ├── Deploy the Policy in Real-World Applications (Robotics, Game AI, Traffic Optimization)  
│ ├── Monitor Real-World Performance (Track live performance metrics)  
│ ├── Adapt Policy if Environment Changes (Handle non-stationary environments)  
│ ├── Improve Q-Learning with Function Approximation (Use Deep Q-Networks if needed)  
│ ├── Implement Continuous Learning (Update Q-table dynamically)  
│ ├── Test for Edge Cases (Handle unexpected state transitions)  
│ ├── Compare Against Other RL Methods (Evaluate performance vs. SARSA, DDPG)  
│ ├── Ensure Policy Robustness (Avoid overfitting to training environment)  
│ └── Automate Policy Updates (Periodic retraining for long-term optimization)
