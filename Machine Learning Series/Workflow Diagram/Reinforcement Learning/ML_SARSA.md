Main Flow Diagram for SARSA:
Environment → Preprocessing → Train-Test Split → Train Base Model (SARSA) → Evaluate → Deploy Policy.

Detailed Workflow Diagram for SARSA:
Raw Data
│
├── Environment Setup → Define the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
│ ├── Identify States (S) → Possible situations the agent can be in
│ ├── Define Actions (A) → Possible moves the agent can make
│ ├── Specify Rewards (R) → Positive/negative feedback for actions
│ ├── Define Transition Function (P) → Probability of moving from one state to another
│ ├── Set Terminal Conditions → Define when an episode ends
│ └── Define Observation Space → Format of environment state input (e.g., images, vectors)
│
├── Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
│ ├── Visualize the Environment (Render environment for debugging)
│ ├── Analyze Initial State Distribution (Identify starting positions)
│ ├── Assess Reward Distribution (Check for reward sparsity)
│ ├── Identify Potential State Loops (Detect infinite loops in state transitions)
│ ├── Evaluate Action Effectiveness (Analyze long-term impact of actions)
│ ├── Normalize Observations (Ensure input consistency)
│ ├── Analyze Convergence Requirements (Determine episode count for stability)
│ └── Check Memory Requirements (Ensure replay buffer feasibility)
│
├── Preprocessing
│ ├── Encode State Representations (Convert raw observations into tensor format)
│ ├── Normalize Input Data (Rescale pixel values, standardize features)
│ ├── Initialize Neural Network (Define architecture for value estimation)
│ ├── Define Hyperparameters (Learning rate α, discount factor γ, exploration rate ε)
│ ├── Implement Experience Replay (Store and sample past experiences)
│ ├── Use Target Network (Stabilize Q-value updates)
│ ├── Configure Logging (Track loss, rewards, and Q-value trends)
│ └── Set Exploration Strategy (ε-Greedy, Annealed Exploration, or Noisy Networks)
│
├── Train-Test Split
│ ├── Train (80%) → Use majority of episodes for training the neural network
│ ├── Validation (10%) → Tune hyperparameters like learning rate and discount factor
│ └── Test (10%) → Evaluate final policy on unseen episodes
│
├── Base Model Training (SARSA)
│ ├── Initialize Q-Table or Value Function Approximator
│ ├── Loop through Episodes (Repeat training over multiple episodes)
│ ├── Select Action Using ε-Greedy Strategy
│ ├── Observe Next State and Reward
│ ├── Select Next Action (SARSA updates Q-value using the next chosen action)
│ ├── Compute Target Q-Values Using SARSA Update Rule:
│ │ Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α [R + γ Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
│ ├── Compute Loss (Mean Squared Error or Temporal Difference Error)
│ ├── Backpropagate Error and Update Neural Network Weights
│ ├── Decay Exploration Rate Over Time (Reduce ε)
│ ├── Track Episode Rewards and Loss Trends
│ ├── Save Best Model Weights
│ └── Store Final Policy for Deployment
│
├── Evaluation
│ ├── Compute Average Reward per Episode (Measure policy improvement)
│ ├── Visualize Training Loss (Check model convergence)
│ ├── Assess Policy Stability (Ensure optimal actions are consistently chosen)
│ ├── Compare Performance With Baseline Policies (Random or Rule-Based Agents)
│ ├── Validate Generalization (Test model in unseen environments)
│ ├── Track Success Rate (Measure episode completion performance)
│ ├── Identify Failure Cases (Analyze incorrect actions)
│ ├── Evaluate Sample Efficiency (Check how fast the model learns)
│ ├── Tune Hyperparameters If Necessary
│ └── Consider Alternative Architectures (Function Approximation, Deep SARSA, etc.)
│
├── Deploy Policy
│ ├── Use Trained Policy for Action Selection
│ ├── Deploy Model in Real-World Applications (Robotics, Finance, Traffic Systems, Game AI)
│ ├── Monitor Real-World Performance (Track deployment metrics)
│ ├── Adapt Model for Changing Environments (Handle non-stationary dynamics)
│ ├── Improve SARSA with Advanced Techniques (e.g., Eligibility Traces)
│ ├── Implement Continuous Learning (Update model periodically with new data)
│ ├── Test for Edge Cases (Analyze performance under extreme conditions)
│ ├── Compare Against Other RL Methods (Evaluate SARSA vs. Q-Learning, PPO, A3C)
│ ├── Ensure Policy Robustness (Avoid overfitting to training scenarios)
│ └── Automate Model Updates (Scheduled retraining for long-term improvement)
