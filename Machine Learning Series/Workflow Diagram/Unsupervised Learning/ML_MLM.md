Detailed Workflow Diagram for Masked Language Modeling (MLM):
Raw Data
│
├── Data Collection → Ensure Data Completeness and Balance
│
├── Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
│   ├── Descriptive Statistics (Examine Distributions of Text Length, Word Frequency)
│   ├── Visualize Word Embeddings (e.g., via t-SNE or PCA)
│   ├── Identify Meaningful Patterns or Linguistic Features
│   ├── Outlier Detection (Identify Unusual Sentences or Tokens)
│   └── Check Data Quality and Label Consistency (for labeled data if available)
│
├── Preprocessing
│   ├── Tokenize Text (Convert text into individual tokens)
│   ├── Normalize or Standardize Data (Lowercase, remove special characters, etc.)
│   ├── Handle Missing or Incomplete Data (e.g., remove empty sentences)
│   ├── Mask Tokens in Sentences (Randomly mask some tokens for MLM task)
│   ├── Feature Engineering (Create embeddings or augment with contextualized data)
│   └── Select Appropriate Data Representations (Tokenized text, word embeddings)
│
├── Data Splitting
│   ├── Train (80%) → Used for training the MLM model
│   ├── Validation (10%) → Tune Hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, masking ratio)
│   └── Test (10%) → Evaluate generalization of masked language modeling
│
├── Base Model Training (Masked Language Modeling)
│   ├── Define the MLM Task (Predict masked tokens in the text)
│   ├── Choose a Model Architecture (e.g., Transformer, BERT)
│   ├── Mask a Proportion of Tokens (Randomly mask tokens in the input text)
│   ├── Use Cross-Entropy Loss to Train Model (Compare predicted tokens with true tokens)
│   ├── Train the Model to Predict Correct Tokens for Masked Positions
│   ├── Use Backpropagation to Update Weights
│   ├── Regularization to Prevent Overfitting (e.g., dropout, attention masking)
│   ├── Adjust Learning Rate or Batch Size During Training
│   ├── Monitor Convergence and Loss During Training
│   └── Save Model Weights and Pretrained Representations
│
├── Evaluation
│   ├── Evaluate Model Accuracy on Test Set (how well the model predicts masked tokens)
│   ├── Measure Performance (e.g., perplexity, token prediction accuracy)
│   ├── Analyze Effectiveness of Pretraining (use embeddings for downstream tasks)
│   ├── Visualize Model's Attention Maps (to understand which tokens are being attended to)
│   ├── Fine-Tune Model on Specific Tasks (e.g., text classification, question answering)
│   ├── Compare MLM Results with Other Pretrained Models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
│   └── Assess Stability and Generalization Across Different Data Subsets
│
├── Predict New Data
│   ├── Preprocess New Data (Same Tokenization and Preprocessing as Training Data)
│   ├── Apply MLM to Predict Missing Tokens in New Sentences
│   ├── Evaluate Similarity of Predicted Tokens to Ground Truth
│   ├── Generate Predictions for Masked Tokens (text completion, suggestion)
│   ├── Store Predicted Tokens for Future Use (e.g., for downstream NLP tasks)
│   ├── Use MLM Representation for Transfer Learning to Other Tasks
│   └── Deploy Model for Real-time Text Prediction or NLP Tasks
│
└── Monitoring
    ├── Monitor Model Performance Over Time (Adapt to New Text Data)
    ├── Track Shifts in Language Distribution (Ensure model adapts to new language trends)
    ├── Retrain Model if Prediction Quality Decreases
    ├── Fine-Tune Model for Specific Tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition)
    ├── Evaluate Model on Additional NLP Tasks (translation, summarization, etc.)
    └── Automate Regular Updates if Required (e.g., retraining with new datasets)
