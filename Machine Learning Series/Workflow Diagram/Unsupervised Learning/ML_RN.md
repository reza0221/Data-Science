Raw Data
│
├── Data Collection → Ensure a diverse dataset with varied orientations
│
├── Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
│ ├── Examine Image Distributions (Check aspect ratios, resolution, color balance)
│ ├── Visualize Image Representations (e.g., t-SNE on feature maps)
│ ├── Identify Meaningful Structural Patterns (e.g., object alignments)
│ ├── Detect Outliers (e.g., corrupted or misaligned images)
│ └── Check Data Completeness and Balance (Avoid overrepresentation of certain orientations)
│
├── Preprocessing
│ ├── Resize and Normalize Images (Standardize pixel values)
│ ├── Convert to Grayscale (Optional for reduced complexity)
│ ├── Augment Data (e.g., noise addition, slight distortions)
│ ├── Apply Rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and Label Accordingly
│ ├── Convert Images to Tensor Format
│ └── Split into Batches for Efficient Processing
│
├── Data Splitting
│ ├── Train (80%) → Used for training RotNet to predict rotation angles
│ ├── Validation (10%) → Tune Hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate)
│ └── Test (10%) → Evaluate rotation prediction accuracy
│
├── Base Model Training (Rotation Prediction Task)
│ ├── Define the Rotation Prediction Task (Classify images into 4 rotation classes: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
│ ├── Choose Model Architecture (e.g., CNN-based network, ResNet, or MobileNet)
│ ├── Apply Rotations to Input Images (Same transformations used in preprocessing)
│ ├── Use Cross-Entropy Loss to Train Model (Compare predicted rotations with true labels)
│ ├── Train the Model to Predict Correct Rotation Angles
│ ├── Backpropagate Errors and Update Model Weights
│ ├── Regularization to Prevent Overfitting (e.g., dropout, batch normalization)
│ ├── Monitor Training Progress (Loss and Accuracy Trends)
│ ├── Adjust Learning Rate or Batch Size for Optimization
│ └── Save Model Weights for Future Use
│
├── Evaluation
│ ├── Measure Model Accuracy on Test Set (Percentage of correctly predicted rotations)
│ ├── Assess Performance Using Confusion Matrix and Class-wise Metrics
│ ├── Analyze Model Robustness to Different Image Variations (e.g., brightness, noise)
