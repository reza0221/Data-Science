Detailed Workflow Diagram for mSLAM:
Raw Data
│
├── Data Collection → Gather diverse multilingual speech and text datasets
│ ├── Ensure representation of various languages, dialects, and accents
│ ├── Include transcribed text alongside speech recordings
│ ├── Cover different domains (e.g., news, conversational, formal, informal)
│ └── Balance datasets to avoid language overrepresentation
│
├── Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
│ ├── Analyze Speech Length Distributions (Check for outliers and missing segments)
│ ├── Compute Phoneme and Word Frequency Distributions (Identify common linguistic patterns)
│ ├── Visualize Text Embeddings (e.g., t-SNE on sentence representations)
│ ├── Identify Language-Specific Variations (Check for unique phonetic patterns)
│ ├── Detect Outliers (e.g., misaligned transcriptions, noisy recordings)
│ └── Assess Data Completeness and Balance Across Languages
│
├── Preprocessing
│ ├── Convert Audio to Text (Automatic Speech Recognition - ASR)
│ ├── Normalize Text Transcriptions (Remove punctuation, standardize spellings)
│ ├── Tokenize Text Data (WordPiece, SentencePiece, or BPE encoding)
│ ├── Extract Speech Features (e.g., MFCCs, Mel-Spectrograms, Wave2Vec embeddings)
│ ├── Align Speech and Text Modalities (Ensure synchronization of paired data)
│ ├── Apply Augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, speed variation, text paraphrasing)
│ ├── Create Positive Pairs (Aligned speech-text representations with variations)
│ ├── Generate Negative Pairs (Randomly sample different sentences across languages)
│ └── Prepare Batched Inputs for Efficient Training
│
├── Data Splitting
│ ├── Train (80%) → Used for contrastive learning in mSLAM
│ ├── Validation (10%) → Tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size)
│ └── Test (10%) → Evaluate multilingual representation quality
│
├── Base Model Training (Contrastive Learning Task)
│ ├── Define the Contrastive Learning Objective (Align speech and text embeddings)
│ ├── Choose Model Architecture (e.g., Transformer-based model like mBERT, XLS-R, Wav2Vec)
│ ├── Apply Noise to Augmented Positive Pairs (e.g., dropout, Gaussian noise)
│ ├── Use Contrastive Loss (NT-Xent or InfoNCE Loss) to Train Model
│ ├── Train the Model to Maximize Similarity for Matched Speech-Text Pairs and Minimize for Mismatched Pairs
│ ├── Backpropagate Errors and Update Model Weights
│ ├── Apply Regularization Techniques (e.g., layer normalization, dropout)
│ ├── Monitor Training Progress (Loss Reduction and Alignment Improvement)
│ ├── Fine-Tune Learning Rate or Batch Size for Optimization
│ └── Save Model Weights for Future Use
│
├── Evaluation
│ ├── Compute Speech-Text Alignment Scores (Measure how well audio and text embeddings match)
│ ├── Evaluate Multilingual Embedding Quality on Benchmark Datasets (e.g., CoVoST, Common Voice)
│ ├── Measure Performance Using Pearson/Spearman Correlation
│ ├── Assess Robustness Across Different Languages and Accents
│ ├── Visualize Embedding Clusters (e.g., t-SNE or UMAP for language-specific embeddings)
│ ├── Compare Performance Against Other Multilingual Speech-Language Models
│ └── Check Generalization on Unseen Speech and Text Data
│
├── Predict New Data
│ ├── Preprocess New Speech and Text Data (Apply the same transformations as training)
│ ├── Encode Speech and Text Using Trained mSLAM Model
│ ├── Retrieve Aligned Multimodal Embeddings
│ ├── Compute Similarity Scores Between Speech and Corresponding Text
│ ├── Evaluate Consistency of Cross-Modal Representations
│ ├── Utilize Embeddings for Downstream Tasks (e.g., translation, summarization, speech retrieval)
│ └── Deploy Model for Real-World Applications
│
└── Monitoring
├── Monitor Model Performance Across Different Languages and Domains
├── Track Variability in Speech and Text Datasets Over Time
├── Retrain Model if Cross-Modal Alignment Performance Declines
├── Fine-Tune Model for Specific Use Cases (e.g., medical transcription, legal speech-to-text)
├── Evaluate mSLAM’s Impact on Downstream NLP and Speech Processing Tasks
└── Automate Periodic Model Updates for Improved Robustness
