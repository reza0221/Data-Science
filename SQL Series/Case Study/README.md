This Case Study shows database management for a simple ecommerce case. MySQL Workbench is used as database management and SQL Alchemy for further analysis needs (with fewer datasets). If the database is considered a big data category, then it would be better to use Spark SQL.
Description of files in this Case Study folder:
- mysqldump folder contains text files generated by the mysqldump utility, which contain SQL statements necessary to recreate the original database.
- case1_ecommerce.sql is a step by step database creation from scratch for a simple database.
- checklist_before_creating_stored_procedure.sql contains a list of checks for a database before creating a stored procedure.
- ecommerce.ipynb uses sql alchemy to load the mysql database for further analysis.
- stored_procedure.msql contains a stored procedure to update payments.amount where previously we updated it initially for several columns in several tables before calling the stored procedure.
- ecommerce.mwb contains the EER Diagram.
